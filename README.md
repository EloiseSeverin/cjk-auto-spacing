# CJK Auto Spacing

A pelican plugin to insert spaces between Chinese/Japanese/Korean characters and English words.

# Why

For Chinese readers, If Chinese characters and English words are put together without a single tiny space, they are reading for torture rather than pleasure. 

Moreover, research shows those who like putting Chinese characters and English words together with no space between them are more trouble in love([why not space?]in Chinese).
Up to 70% get married with ones they don't love at 34 years old.
And the remaining 30%, even worse, they have no one to inherent their legacies except their cats. 

For the sake of writing and love, it's not hard to conclude that there must be space for pelican users who write in Chinese. 

I'm not a Japanese or Korean speaker, but the same thing can be concluded. 
After all, they have lots in common with Chinese. And that's exactly why they together as a whole are called CJK Unified Ideographs in unicode standards
