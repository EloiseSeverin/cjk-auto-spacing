# CJK Auto Spacing

A pelican plugin to insert spaces between Chinese/Japanese/Korean characters and English words.

For Chinese readers, If Chinese and English characters are put together without a single tiny space, they are reading for torture rather than pleasure. 
Moreover, research shows those who like putting Chinese and English characters together with no space between them are more trouble in love[^1].
Up to 70% get married with ones they don't love at 34 years old.
And the remaining 30%, even worse, there is no one to inherent their legacies except their cats. 
For the sake of writing and love, it's not hard to conclude that there must be space for pelican users who speak Chinese.
